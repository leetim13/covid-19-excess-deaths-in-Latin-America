# covid-19-excess-deaths-in-Latin-America
Inspired from The Economist article on “Tracking covid-19 excess deaths across countries” (The Economist, 2021), this report aims to investigate the proportion of overall excess deaths vs the official reported death counts in the Latin America region due to the covid-19 pandemic using a Bayesian approach (R-INLA).

The term “excess deaths” is defined as the “difference between the observed numbers of deaths in specific
time periods and expected numbers of deaths in the same time periods” (CDC, 2022). This distinction is especially
important in the context of the covid-19 pandemic as it is crucial to recognize that causes of deaths are hard to be
attributed to specific factors since “some deaths due to covid-19 may be assigned to other causes of deaths, [hence]
tracking all-cause mortality can provide information about whether an excess number of deaths is observed, even
when COVID-19 mortality may be undercounted.” (CDC, 2022).
